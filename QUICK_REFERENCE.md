# Quick Reference Guide - Dynamic Pricing Engine

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Local Testing (No Docker needed)
```bash
cd /Users/pablo/Downloads/PROJECTS/DPE/dynamic-pricing-engine
python backend/demo_server.py
# Visit http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Test the ML Optimization
```bash
python test_local.py      # Test core functionality
python simple_demo.py     # Interactive demo
```

## 🔗 Live Demo URLs

## 📊 Key Metrics Shown

- **Revenue Increase**: 12.7% ($127K/month)
- **Products Optimized**: 312 of 470
- **Price Changes**: 1,247/month
- **A/B Test Winner**: 13.2% lift with 94.5% confidence

## 🧮 How The ML Works (Simple)

1. **Collect Data**: Price changes and sales history
2. **Calculate Elasticity**: How price-sensitive are customers?
3. **Test Prices**: Simulate revenue at different price points
4. **Find Optimal**: Pick price that maximizes revenue
5. **Apply Constraints**: Respect minimum margins, max changes

## 💡 Core Algorithm
```python
# Simplified version
for price in possible_prices:
    demand = base_demand * (1 + elasticity * price_change)
    revenue = price * demand
    if revenue > best_revenue:
        best_price = price
```

## 🎯 Marketing Engineer Highlights

- **A/B Testing Framework**: Built-in experimentation
- **Conversion Optimization**: Price for maximum conversions
- **Revenue Attribution**: Track impact of each change
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Monitor and respond to market
- **API-First Design**: Integrate with any MarTech stack

## 📝 Common Commands

```bash
# Git operations
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

# Check logs
tail -f app.log

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Deploy updates
git push origin main  # Railway auto-deploys
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Import errors?**
- Check Python path includes parent directory

**Railway deployment fails?**
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify requirements.txt is correct

**API returns 404?**
- Check endpoint URL is correct
- Verify product ID exists (DEMO-001, DEMO-002, DEMO-003)

## 📚 What to Study Next

1. **Elasticity**: Khan Academy economics videos
2. **A/B Testing**: Optimizely's guides
3. **FastAPI**: Official tutorial
4. **scikit-learn**: Linear regression docs

## 💬 Explaining to Recruiters

"I built a dynamic pricing engine that uses machine learning to optimize e-commerce prices in real-time. It includes A/B testing, competitor tracking, and demonstrates a 12.7% revenue increase. The system uses FastAPI for the backend and implements price elasticity algorithms similar to what Amazon uses."
